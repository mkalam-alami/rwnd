            I reach the mansion, but remain far enough to stay hidden by the darkness. A warm light escapes the entrance, while chatter and glass clinkings can be heard.
            A receptionist stands by the door.

            {{^redShotMe}}{{^redFollowsMe}}The young employee, filled with boredom at this time of the evening, notices me and smiles. I introduce myself:
            « Good evening my friend! I'm invited under the name... »{{/redFollowsMe}}{{#redFollowsMe}}I get closer to the mansion, and the receptionist is no one but Red Spade. He  jiggles his gun while taunting me:
            « You played, and lost my dear friend. Soon, I will finish building by time bomb, and will freeze your whole country in time for a hundred years! And it will all be possible thanks to this. » He brandishes an old pocket watch, the perfect look-alike to mine.
            « After being frozen in time, your civilization will be completely obsolete, and your ancient technologies will be of no help when I'll come and invade it!! »
            He bursts into an unpleasant laugh.{{/redFollowsMe}}{{/redShotMe}}{{#redShotMe}}I take a deep breath: I'm still alive! I feel my chest with my hands, to find the wound has disappeared. I give myself a few seconds to calm down and catch my breath.
            
            Red is still looking out from the mansion's entrance.{{/redShotMe}}

            While listening to his speech, I slowly got closer to him. In a desperate effort, I pounce on him to disarm and ground him.
            
            Unfortunately, Red is the faster one, and his weapon shoots.
            
            It's strange... For a moment, during my fall to the groud, I notice how his left eye looks somehow... abnormal. Amorphous. A glass eye maybe? This must be new, since I knew him for ten years and never noticed a such thing.
            
            I am now laying on my back, and feel a dull pain in my chest. I tilt my head to see a red shape growing on my shirt. My vision gets blurry... I try one last time to focus on my watch.

        text: "I slowly make a detour, to take advantage of that blind spot left by Red's fake eye. I am soon standing behind him, my knife in hand. I spot the old watch in his back pocket, the chain hanging a little bit."

            In a fluid motion, I throw away Red's watch out of his reach and grab him, locking his arm, a knife under his throat. Red gasps, then says hoarsely:
            « Nice move, but it's not over yet! »
            He uses his free arm to reach for his back pocket, probably to use his watch. His arrogant look suddenly fades away. I tighten my grip.
            
            
            A few minutes later, I finally hold in my hands the goal of the mission. This file contains everything needed to build a mass weapon able to stop time... So much power cannot end up in the wrong hands.
            
            
            I get closer to the fireplace, and hesitate a moment, about to betray my mission orders. In an abrupt move, I throw the documents in the flames. Red's ancient watch quickly follows, bursting into colorful sparkles. 
           
            I finally grab my own watch, the last specimen of a long forgotten technology. Should I throw it in the fire? Destroy it for good?

            The watch disappears in the flames, and I suddenly feel powerless.
            
            Powerless and... Excited? Each and every choice I'll now make will really matter, at last. It's finally time to move forward.
            
            *THE END*

            I enter a large, luxuriously decorated room. Men in suits and women in evening dresses chat in small groups. Most of them hold a glass of wine or champagne. An appetizing buffet takes up a whole wall.
            
            It takes me a while to locate the back stairs, because of a large chandelier blocking my view. That's where I have to go next: the office must be on the upper floor.

            I politely smile at him:
            « Excuse me sir, I was looking for the bathroom and— »
            With unexpected speed, the guard smashes me against the wall, a hand over my mouth. Then a sudden, unbearable pain hits my belly, and I start to lose consciousness... I must... Quickly...

            The key matches. I'm in!
            
            The door opens on a large and softly lit room, where  floats a scent of tobacco. Rows of books cover the walls, except one spot where a small chimney stands.
            A large desk, tastefully decorated, sits at the back of the office. There's nobody here.

            I've barely started to inspect the desk contents when a soft swish makes me turn aside. A bookcase is moving away from the wall, and a tall man stands in the opening. He holds a file in his hand.
            
            I recognize that silhouette. It must be *Red Spade*... An old colleague.
            
            He takes a step forward into the light, and breaks the silence with haughty laughter:
            
            « {{#heart}}Black Heart{{/heart}}{{^heart}}Red Club{{/heart}}, is this you? So they sent you here! It seems like they take my project very seriously... »
            « Red Spade. So you're the one behind that weapon project. I will stop you from building it! »
            
            Armed guards burst into the office.

            While the guards approach me, Red Spade waves his file at me:
            
            « I suppose this is what you came for, isn't it? Too bad, you were so close to your goal! »
            « Oh, don't worry about me. »
            
            I should be able to get back into the office with a different, faster way. What about climbing the wall up to the windows?

            {{^redFollowsMe}}I get around the vigilance of the receptionist, and start walking along the outer wall, hidden by the night. I locate the office window, then untie my shoes and start climbing.
            I quickly reach the office. Fortunately, the window is still (or should I say already?) open.{{/redFollowsMe}}{{#redFollowsMe}}I sprint towards the office window. Suddenly a shot is fired, and a piece of the wall bursts inches away from me.
            
            I turn around. Where the receptionist once was stands Red, with an evil smile and a gun pointed right at me.
            « You just can't escape! » he shouts.
            
            Could he have the same power as me? How can I fight him then? I have to go back further!{{/redFollowsMe}}

            I run through the room without finding anything useful. What I'm looking for is not here anyway, I'm sure the documents are behind this passage.
            
            To gain a few precious seconds, I use my watch to go back in time a little bit.

            I run my hands through the bookcase, looking for an opening or something. I end up noticing a crack in the back of the wall, between two books.
            I grab and unfold my switchblade, then stick the end through the crack.
            A click is triggered.

            The piece of furniture slides easily and silently. I enter the passage... And end up face-to-face with Red Spade.
            « You are too slow! » he exclaims, brandishing a blade.
            
            How is it possible? I have to try again. Maybe climb the wall again, faster this time?
