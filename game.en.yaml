            I reach the entrance of the building. Chatter and glass clinkings can be heard from inside.
            A receptionist stands by the door.

            The young employee, filled with boredom at this time of the evening, notices me and smiles. I introduce myself:
            « Good evening my friend! I'm invited under the name... »

            Just a little mishap.

            The employee turns away to go through his list, then turns back with a saddened face.
            « I am very sorry Sir, but I can't find your name... »
            « Are you sure? You looked for {{#heart}}Black Heart{{/heart}}{{^heart}}Red Club{{/heart}}, right? »
            « Again I am sorry, but your name's not on that list. »
            Just a little mishap.

            « See that ancient watch? Behind that outdated technology actually lies marvelous powers. »
            The receptionist seems amused.
            « What kind of powers? »
            « This device allows me to travel through time. And therefore to gain access to unlimited knowledge! »
            « Uh, I don't see the link between... time travel and... knowledge? »
            « Doesn't matter— my point is, I'm about to find out what the inside pocket of your jacket contains. »

            « Haha well tried! »
            « What a shame, I guess I failed, » I answer with humility. « What was it? »
            « I've seen better magicians! It actually was a hundred-dollar tip », he says proudly.
            « That's all I needed to know... »
            Before his puzzled look, I slowly raise my pocket watch in front of me, close my eyes, and picture a point back in time...

            I grab a wallet from my back pocket, then, in a theatrical gesture, make a hundred dollar bill come out of it.
            
            The receptionnist's eyes widen for a split second. He then turns around to check his own wallet. I take advantage of his distraction to quickly get around him and reach the guest list. I barely have the time to read one name: Boris Rosing.
            
            « You almost got me her— hey what are you doing? »
            I close my eyes and concentrate once again.

            The employee turns away to go through his list, then comes back to me to make a quick bow.
            « I wish you a warm welcome, Sir Rosing. It's a pleasure to have you with us tonight. »
